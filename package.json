  "description": "## Background and Overview SpaceSpelunkers is a cavern exploration game that utilizes cellular automata to procedurally generate random caverns full of treasures and bad guys for the user to explore.  Armed with nothing but an echolocation device, a flashlight, and a trusty laser sword, it is up to the player to explore the cave and uncover its secrets! It features 3 different modes: * Arcade Mode, which is how the game is meant to be played.  Players will be able to choose the relative difficulty of the cave they will be exploring by selecting different methods of random cave generation using different configurations for a Turing machine. * Beginner Mode, which is the same as arcade mode, except the player will have more visibility.   * Zen Mode, which allows the user to play around with the random cave generating Turing machine and view the different settings and the caverns generated by them.",
