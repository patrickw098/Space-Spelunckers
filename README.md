### SpaceSpelunkers!

## Background and Overview
SpaceSpelunkers is a cavern exploration game that utilizes cellular automata to procedurally generate random caverns full of treasures and bad guys for the user to explore.  Armed with nothing but an echolocation device, a flashlight, and a trusty laser sword, it is up to the player to explore the cave and uncover its secrets!
It features 3 different modes:
* Arcade Mode, which is how the game is meant to be played.  Players will be able to choose the relative difficulty of the cave they will be exploring by selecting different methods of random cave generation using different configurations for a Turing machine.
* Beginner Mode, which is the same as arcade mode, except the player will have more visibility.  
* Zen Mode, which allows the user to play around with the random cave generating Turing machine and view the different settings and the caverns generated by them.

## Functionality and MVPs
Players will be able to select different settings for the rules of randomly generating a cavern using cellular automata.  When the player hits "Play Game!" the cavern will be generated, along with treasures and bad guys.  Players will only be able to see in a small radius around them, and must use echolocation to determine the location of walls, bad guys, and treasures.  Using a laser sword, players will be destroy their enemies as they advance through the cavern.

* Random procedurally generated caverns based on player inputted settings.
* Players can interact with these caverns
* Players can use echolocation to navigate through the caverns
* Players will encounter randomly generated enemies and treasures.
* Players will be able to defeat these enemies.

Additionally, there will be a zen mode in which players can simply view the randomly generated caverns in their entirety based on whatever configurations they have selected.  In zen mode, players will not be able to use a character to interact with the procedurally generated cavern.

## Architectures and Technologies
The project will utilize the following technologies:
* Vanilla javascript, canvas, and DOM manipulation for rendering the environment and its characters.
* Webpack to bundle the files.
* Cellular automata logic for procedurally generating the caverns.  

The game will likely need the following files:
`bundle.js` for bundling the game information
`cavern.js` for creating the random maps
`spelunkers.js` for handling the game logic and instantiating the game.
`creatures.js` for storing the character objects such as, the player, enemies, and treasures.  
`projectiles.js` for handling the logic of moving objects such as the flash light and the echolocation.

##Proposed Timeline
### Project start ~ Monday, July 18
Finish the logic for procedurally generating the caverns.  Find a way to fix it onto a HTML page in a way that makes sense.  Enable a light/dark toggle feature to differentiate between Arcade mode and Beginner mode.

### Tuesday, July 19 ~ Wednesday July 20
Finish creating all the classes that the game will need as well as the projectiles logic.  Render them onto the page.

### Wednesday July 20 ~ Thursday, July 21
Finish polishing up the two main game modes.  Start working on Zen mode to procedurally generate different types of caverns using different Turing machine configurations.  

### Thursday, July 21 ~ Friday, July 22
Polish up the product, add sprites for the monsters and the player.
